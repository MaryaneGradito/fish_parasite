## About The Project

This project looks at the effect of internal parasites on the fish host personality, the pumpkinseed sunfish.
Data were collected between May-September 2022 at la Station de Biologie des Laurentides, Université de Montréal, Canada.

The objective is to determine whether an experimental co-infection caused by trematodes (*Uvulifer ambloplitis* and *Apophallus sp*)
and cestodes (*Proteocephalus ambloplitis*) will change the host’s personality (*Lepomis gibbosus*). We looked at exploration, boldness 
and activity before and after an experimental infection in a semi-natural environment (caging experiment in lake). 

This project will generate complex datasets (i.e. repeated measures of behavioral traits through time, responses following a perturbation). 
This type of data structure could apply to researchers working on a wide range of physiological, morphological or behavioural traits.
