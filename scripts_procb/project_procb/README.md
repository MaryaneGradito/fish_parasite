Data and R code for: Double trouble? Parasitic co-infection reduces body condition and activity levels in pumpkinseed sunfish

## About The Project

This project looks at the effect of internal parasites on the fish host personality, the pumpkinseed sunfish.
Data were collected between May-September 2022 at la Station de Biologie des Laurentides, Université de Montréal, Canada.

The objective is to determine whether an experimental co-infection caused by trematodes (*Uvulifer ambloplitis* and *Apophallus sp*)
and cestodes (*Proteocephalus ambloplitis*) will change the host’s personality (*Lepomis gibbosus*). We looked at exploration, boldness 
and activity before and after an experimental infection in a semi-natural environment (caging experiment in lake). 

This project will generate complex datasets (i.e. repeated measures of behavioral traits through time, responses following a perturbation). 
This type of data structure could apply to researchers working on a wide range of physiological, morphological or behavioural traits.

### Key File Description

1. all_data_T.csv : raw data collected
2. meta_data.csv : detailed description of each variable 
3. func.r : functions needed for the R code
4. script: R code including models and figures
5. All files named "Cromwell" are used to create a map of the lake. + quai.csv is the dock entry point coordonates.
