<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project looks at the effect of internal parasites on the fish host personality, the pumpkinseed sunfish.
Data were collected between May-September 2022 at la Station de Biologie des Laurentides, Université de Montréal, Canada.

The objective is to determine whether an experimental co-infection caused by trematodes (**Uvulifer ambloplitis** and **Apophallus sp**)
and cestodes (**Proteocephalus ambloplitis**) will change the host’s personality (**Lepomis gibbosus**). We looked at exploration, boldness 
and activity before and after an experimental infection in a semi-natural environment (caging experiment in lake). 

This project will generate complex datasets (i.e. repeated measures of behavioral traits through time, responses following a perturbation). 
This type of data structure could apply to researchers working on a wide range of physiological, morphological or behavioural traits.

### Key File Description

Data_raw folder: you will find all_data.csv, which contains all the data collected for the project. All the variables are explained in the meta.data.csv file.
